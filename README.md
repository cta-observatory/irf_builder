# irf_builder

This is a stand-alone module to compute the instrument response functions (IRFs) for the
Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) gamma observatory.

The module provides methods to generate event weights, do the event selection
(based on minimising the sensitivity),

## TODO
- [ ] doc-strings in many functions
- [ ] write out event tables including the selection flags
- [ ] write out the produced IRFs in _any_ format
- [ ] write out the produced IRFs in an agreed upon format
- [ ] add more plots concerning event discrimination
- [x] write out plots
- [ ] unit test everything
